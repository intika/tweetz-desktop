==============

Desktop Twitter client written in WPF

See http://mike-ward.net/tweetz for more information.

In this fork in the directory Transparent-Version 
I compiled different versions with different transparency percentage... 
i don't really have the time to add it as feature for the moment 
The _xx correspond to the transparency value example tweetz_45.exe have 45% transparency
